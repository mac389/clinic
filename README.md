clinic (0.5.0)
======

This repostitory contains tools to make the rigorous analysis of large clinical datases more accesible to the general community. A working knowledge of basic statistics and Python is assumed. By basic stats knowledge I mean the concepts of mean, median, and p-values. By basic Python I mean the ability to install a Python module and its dependencies on a local machine and type one-line Python commands in Terminal.
